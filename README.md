## Customer Churn prediction

# 🎯 Project Overview

- With the rapid advancement in data science and artificial intelligence, understanding customer behavior has become crucial for businesses to tailor their services effectively. This project leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze customer data and classify them based on various features such as service subscriptions, preferred payment methods, and demographic attributes. The insights gained from this analysis help businesses make informed decisions on marketing strategies and customer targeting.

# 🛠️ Models Used

To gain a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior, several machine learning and deep learning models were implemented, including:

- **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification tasks to predict whether a customer follows a specific behavior or not.
- **Decision Tree & Random Forest**: Effective in understanding how decisions are made based on different customer attributes, providing clear interpretability.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Applied for complex classifications, ensuring high accuracy in distinguishing data points.
- **Deep Learning Models**:
  - **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**: Used to process large datasets and extract deep patterns.
  - **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: Helps in analyzing sequential data and predicting future trends based on past information.
  - **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**: A simplified alternative to LSTM for processing time-series data.

# 🧰 Model Training

- All models were trained using customer data, where hyperparameters were optimized to achieve the best possible performance. The dataset was split into training and testing sets to ensure fair evaluation.

# 📊 Model Evaluation

To assess the performance of each model, key evaluation metrics were used:

- **Accuracy**: Measures how well the model predicts correct outcomes.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Analyzes misclassifications and helps refine the model.
- **Loss Function**: Evaluates the error rate over training epochs, with lower loss indicating better performance.

- The evaluation results were visualized through charts and graphs to show how accuracy and loss evolved over time, offering clear insights into each model's effectiveness.

# 🔍 Model Comparison

After evaluating all models, their performance was analyzed to determine the best model based on accuracy, error rate, and overall predictive power. The findings revealed that:

- **Random Forest outperformed other models in terms of accuracy and classification efficiency.**

- This suggests that Random Forest is an ideal choice for this type of analysis, particularly when high interpretability and accuracy are required.

# 📈 Visualizations and Results

- Graphs were used to illustrate the performance of different models over time.
- The impact of increasing training epochs on accuracy and loss was analyzed.
- Trends in classification errors and accuracy were visualized to help select the best model.
